                            Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I was born in Japan, spent my formative years in the Philippines and Africa, my high school years were split between Virginia and Illinois, all leading up to my current residency in California, where I went to university. In addition, I have visited more countries than I can count on my fingers and toes, and probably yours as well. As such, I am a multicultural citizen of the world!                        </p>

                        <p id="▉▊para2">
                            I am a pretty big nerd. I play card games like <span class="emphasis">Magic: The Gathering</span> and board games like <span class="emphasis">Settlers of Catan</span>. I am into video games like <span class="emphasis">Pokémon</span> and indie games like <span class="emphasis">Terraria</span>, <span class="emphasis">Stardew Valley</span>, and <span class="emphasis">Minecraft</span>, if that can still be considered indie after Microsoft bought it… As you can see, I like games. I like other things too, however. Drawing, swimming, cooking, comic books, movies, and coding, to name a few.
                        
                        <p id="▉▊para3">
                            I like solving problems and working in teams, as well as learning new things, such as coding and design. I have always been drawn to creative outlets like drawing, but at the same time I have always felt I have a very logical and analytical mind. I think these two traits will serve me well as a web developer.                        </p>
